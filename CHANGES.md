### 1.4.1
* Fixing naming convention for a few functions (conflict with theme)

### 1.4.0
* Adding gulp
* Removing codekit support

### 1.3.0
* Adding update capabilities through PUC
* Adding link to documentation (currently unused, but at least linking over)
* Removing unused Gutenberg styles (this is a shortcode, after all)
* Removing Genesis dependency (not sure what made it dependent anyway)
* Fixing paths on the CSS files, etc, as they were working but had an extra / in them

### 1.2.0
* Making the content type not public, so that we have a little less weirdness with trying to get to a single post from the backend. Also moving it down below pages.
